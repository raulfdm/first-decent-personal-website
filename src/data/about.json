	"My first contact with development was when I was 14, I had decided to create my own MMORPG (Tibia) server, customizing all of game options and configurations, server and doing a deploy from my code. In a few weeks, I had more than 150 players having fun and asking more upgrades. Nevertheless, I hadn't had idea what should I'd to do and what technology could offer me, than I give up.",
	"At the age of 21, I've enrolled myself in production engineer degree, where I had classes related by development (algorithm and basic of development) and it was enough to change my whole life. My professor saw my feelings and invite to me to change my degree to Systems Information.",
	"In college I've started to learn about data structuring, C#, Java, PHP, Android when I met Javascript and web technologies and I decided to go deep into it and nowadays I'm Front-end/Javascript developer.",
	"Since I was a child I've always been gaming addicted. But today I conclude that I've found the best, the most challenging and the funnier game of all time: Coding!"
